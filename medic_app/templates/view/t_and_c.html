        <span>Confidentiality:</span>We take confidentiality very seriously. All evaluation and treatment information is confidential and can only be released to specified individuals or agencies with your written release. Massachusetts law dictates some important exceptions to confidentiality. A patient presenting imminent danger to self/others is one such exception. Confidentiality with adolescents (fourteen and older) is a sensitive issue that must take into consideration the child's developmental need for privacy with the parents' right to be informed of their child's course of treatment. We are committed to finding the best balance. Before intake you will be asked to sign the Notice of Privacy Practices (HIPPA) form. Additional information about HIPPA will be made available upon request. Patient/Family Concerns Our aim is to provide you with the highest quality care in a pleasant and professional atmosphere. If you have concerns about any aspect of our services, please feel free to inform Amina, PMHNP.</a>

        <span>Medication:</span>Practice believes in the shared decision-making model patient centered care. Shared decision making is a key component of patient- centered health care. It is a process in which clinicians and patients work together to make decisions and select tests, treatments and care plans based on clinical evidence that balances risks and expected outcomes with patient preferences and values. Medications may be recommended to help improve the symptoms which lead you (or your loved one) to seek a consultation. If it is agreed that medications are indicated, your treating clinician will discuss with you the various medications that are available to treat your current condition. Medications’ potential risks and benefits will be explained to you in the language you understand. You will learn about the potential benefits of the medication, possible side effects and risks, its dosage and frequency, possible drug interactions, and any withdrawal symptoms you may experience if you stop taking the medication abruptly. you decide that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks, medications will be prescribed. If you have any questions about the medications, contact the office to talk to the pre1 scribing provider.</a>

        <span>CANCELLATION AND NO! SHOW POLICY:</span>You (or your loved one) will receive the best benefit from treatment if you come to your appointments regularly. If you must cancel an appointment, this Agreement represents your promise that you will do so at least 48 business hours in advance of your scheduled time. If you do not cancel 48 business hours in advance, Amitop Care LLC will need to charge you for a missed session, because your clinician will have reserved that treatment time for you and will be unable to use that time to see any other patient. A missed appointment cannot be billed to your insurance carrier, which means that you will be responsible for paying a $50 cancellation fee for the missed appointment. Amitop Care LLC recognizes that emergencies or other unplanned events do arise that cannot be helped (transportation problems, illness, family emergencies, internet issues). By signing this Agreement, you give your consent to conducting your appointments by telehealth/In person and acknowledge the terms and conditions stated above.

        <span>INSURANCE, BILLING, AND PAYMENTS: </span>Payment in full is due for each appointment at the time of treatment. If you have health insurance, your psychiatric treatment may be covered in whole or in part, also If you participate in a major medical insurance plan and wish to utilize your benefits, we can assist you as an out-of-network provider. You must communicate directly with your insurer prior to your visit to have a clear understanding as to what services may or may not be covered. As a courtesy, we will check with your insurance carrier and make reasonable attempts to determine what you will need to pay at each session; however, we cannot guarantee that the information provided to us is correct, and you are ultimately responsible for determining your insurance coverage and pay for your treatments which are not covered by your insurance plan. Some insurance policies may require a “Prior Authorization” OR an annual minimum “Deductible” payment before covering the costs of treatment. If your policy requires it, we will endeavor to obtain a “Prior Authorization” for your psychiatric treatment. If you have any remaining “Deductible” on your policy at the time of our service, it will need to be paid for by you before your insurance policy will cover the cost of your treatment. You are responsible for full payment if your insurance denies coverage for your treatment. but you are required to pay your co-payment and any deductibles involved. By signing this Agreement, you agree that you will pay any outstanding amounts due and owed to Amtop Cares LLC.

Checks should be made payable to “Amitop care LLC” or at 339- 237-2599 for help in payments and we will email you the payment link.
